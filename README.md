# AWS Serverless Image Processor

A fully serverless image processing pipeline on AWS! Upload an image to S3, automatically process it with lambda and store the result in another S3 bucket and receives an email notification via SNS. I built this project to solve real-world problems like automating image preprocessing in document verification and content platforms and mostly to learn practical knowledge about AWS :)
